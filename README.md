## Inclusion

This library is downloadable via **npm**:

```console
$ npm install scroll-padlock
```

The source code is entirely written in [standard ECMAScript](https://tc39.es/) with no dependencies.
All major budle formats are supported, including [umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), [iife](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), [amd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition), [cjs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS), [esm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs); also, a minified version and a transpiled version through babel are available for each of those.

### Node:

```javascript
import ScrollPadlock from "scroll-padlock/dist/es/scroll-padlock.js";

const scrollPadlock = new ScrollPadlock();
```

### Browser (modules):

```html
<script type="module">
  import ScrollPadlock from "path/to/scroll-padlock/dist/es/scroll-padlock.min.js";

  const scrollPadlock = new ScrollPadlock();
</script>
```

### Browser (globals):

```html
<script src="path/to/scroll-padlock/dist/iife/scroll-padlock.min.js"></script>

<script>
  var scrollPadlock = new ScrollPadlock();
</script>
```

## Under the Hood

Some [CSS variables](#css-variables), addressing a given html element **data attribute** (dinamically set), are set through a `style` appended in `head`, a given **CSS class** is **[observed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)** to determine current state while **[window resize](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resize_event) and [scroll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scroll_event) events** are listened in order to update CSS variables; no other DOM modifications besides that.

## Usage

An instance requires the **html element** which scroll needs to be controlled and the [CSS class](#CSS-Rules-Examples) that would lock it.

```javascript
// The css class with the rules that would lock the page scroll
const SCROLL_LOCKED_CSS_CLASS_NAME = "your-locked-class";

// The element which scroll state needs to be controlled
const { documentElement } = document;

// Creates the instance
const instance = new ScrollPadlock(
  documentElement,
  SCROLL_LOCKED_CSS_CLASS_NAME
);
```

At this point, the lock state can be changed simply **toggling that CSS class**; since the CSS class change is internally observed, the class change itself can be done through native DOM API, a virtual DOM library, another DOM manipulation script, etc...

```javascript
const { classList } = documentElement;

// Locks the body scroll
classList.add(SCROLL_LOCKED_CSS_CLASS_NAME);

// Unlocks the body scroll
classList.remove(SCROLL_LOCKED_CSS_CLASS_NAME);
```

## CSS Rules Examples

The following ruleset alone is enough to ensure a cross-browser body scroll lock for a standard vertical-scroll page:

```css
html.your-locked-class {
  /* Position-fixed hack, locks iOS too */
  position: fixed;
  width: 100%;

  /* Avoids scroll to top */
  top: calc(var(--scroll-padlock-scroll-top) * -1);

  /* Reserves space for scrollbar */
  padding-right: var(--scroll-padlock-scrollbar-width);
}
```

Some [browser recognition logic](https://gist.github.com/memob0x/0869e759887441b1349fdfe6bf5a188d) can be applied in order to address iOS more specifically, keeping the standard overflow approach for the browsers that respects it:

```css
/* iOS only */
html.your-locked-class.ios {
  /* iOS fixed position hack */
  position: fixed;
  width: 100%;

  /* Avoids scroll to top */
  top: calc(var(--scroll-padlock-scroll-top) * -1);
}

/* Standard browsers only */
html.your-locked-class.not-ios,
html.your-locked-class.not-ios body {
  /* Standard way to lock scroll */
  overflow: hidden;
}

html.your-locked-class.not-ios body {
  /* Reserves space for scrollbar */
  /* (iOS has overlay scrollbars, this rule would have no effect there anyway) */
  padding-right: var(--scroll-padlock-scrollbar-width);
}
```

## CSS Variables

This is the complete list of CSS variables set by this library on the given elements.

- `--scroll-padlock-scroll-top`: the number of pixels that the target is scrolled vertically.
- `--scroll-padlock-scroll-left`: the number of pixels that the target is scrolled horizontally.
- `--scroll-padlock-scrollbar-width`: the target's vertical scrollbar size.
- `--scroll-padlock-scrollbar-height`: the target's horizontal scrollbar size.
- `--scroll-padlock-outer-width`: the target's width including the scrollbar size.
- `--scroll-padlock-outer-height`: the target's height including the scrollbar size.
- `--scroll-padlock-inner-width`: the target's width without the scrollbar size.
- `--scroll-padlock-inner-height`: the target's height without the scrollbar size.
- `--scroll-padlock-scroll-width`: the target's content width.
- `--scroll-padlock-scroll-height`: the target's content height.

## API

The `destroy` method is particularly important when using **reactive frameworks** (such as React, Vue, Angular, etc...) which components lifecycle might generate memory leaks: **call `destroy` method when the component in which scroll-padlock is used gets unmounted**.

```javascript
// Detaches instance events, removes styles, etc...
instance.destroy();
```

Some **other methods or accessors** can be useful when custom DOM-manipulation logic takes place.

```javascript
// Updates current instance computed styles (CSS variables, etc...)
instance.update();

// Gets the the current scroll position
const { top, left } = instance.scroll;

// Sets a new scroll position;
// if the instance state is locked,
// the given position is saved for a future restoration;
// otherwise the instance element is directly scrolled to the given position
instance.scroll = { top, left };

// Gets the current instance element layout sizes
const {
  // The target's width and height including the scrollbar size
  outerWidth,
  outerHeight,

  // The target's width and height without the scrollbar size
  innerWidth,
  innerHeight,

  // The target's content width and height
  scrollWidth,
  scrollHeight,

  // The target's vertical and horizontal scrollbar size
  scrollbarWidth,
  scrollbarHeight,
} = instanse.layout;
```

## TL;TR: a body scroll overview

üôÖ `body { overflow: hidden; }` is the most common way to lock the scroll position on every browsers, unfortunately, unless user's browser has overlay scrollbars, that would cause the scrollbar to disappear, the body to expand and the contents to jump to the right ([CLS](https://web.dev/cls/));
to make things worse that technique just **doesn't work** on **iOS safari**: when set the user can still somehow scroll the page.

üôÖ `body { touch-action: none; }` can't help since Safari [doesn't seem to support it](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133112) anytime soon.

ü§∑ Some libraries propose to solve this preventing `touchmove` events, which might work out very well in many cases; unfortunately some **issues** with some **`viewport` configurations** or **pinch to zoom** might still be encountered, also **iOS navigation bars** might end up covering some layout elements.

üôÖ `body { position: fixed; }` alone can force iOS to lock the scroll, but when applied the scroll position would eventually jump to the top of the page.

üíÅ This library sets some **css variables** and **css classes** in order to allow the developer to choose their preferred [CSS-only approach](#usage-pt1-css), while the class instance exposes a quite granular API in order to implement some JS strategies too.

## Positioned Elements

If positioned elements "jumps" on a parent lock state change, the same CSS variables that are used to reserve the scrollbar width can be used to overcome this problem as well.

```css
/* A right-positioned child */
.positioned-element {
  position: fixed;
  right: 0;
}

/* The same right-positioned element, */
/* not affected by its own container scrollbars disappearance */
.your-locked-class .positioned-element {
  right: var(--scroll-padlock-scrollbar-width);
}
```

## iOS Bars and Keyboard Tray

There might still be an iOS edge case when locking body scroll with _position: fixed_ technique.

When the page is scrolled the **system bars** become smaller; at that point, when focusing an input element programmatically, the keyboard tray is triggered and the bars become larger again; that, probably when some animations are taking place, can cause the following visual artifacts.

![ios bug](https://github.com/memob0x/scroll-padlock/blob/master/docs/ios-bug.gif?raw=true)

iOS forces a scroll to the focused element (still out of canvas) in an already "locked" area (limited by the OS itself) which would be also shortly resized because of the system bars getting bigger.

To overcome this problem the native `resize` event can be listened to programmatically scroll to top that ios-keyboard-sub-window-thing.

```javascript
const isIOS = someWayToDetectAppleIOS();

// Addressing the "ios-keyboard-sub-window-thing offset" bug:
// body scroll lock along with a programmatic focus
// on an a form field make the keyboard tray to show
// and that triggers, along with the visual artifact itself, a "resize" event
window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
  if (isIOS && classList.contains(SCROLL_LOCKED_CSS_CLASS_NAME)) {
    // "Re-aligns" the iOS keyboard sub-window
    window.scrollTo(0, 0);
  }
});
```

The problem should be solved at this point.

## Support

All [modern browsers](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-a-modern-browser) have been tested.

The library doesn't provide a fallback for those browsers which don't support [CSS variables](https://caniuse.com/css-variables) (mainly Internet Explorer 11); since these browsers tipically support _overflow: hidden_, the [JS API](#API) can be used to implement the scrollbars-gaps compensation normally achievable through CSS by standard browsers (a graceful degradation approach is highly suggested though).
